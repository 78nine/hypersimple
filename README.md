# hypersimple

The easiest way to use [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML#readme) ðŸ¦„

  * `hooks` like simplicity implemented through the model
  * component implemented as callbacks
  * an entire model/props driven development

#### Example

```js
import {comp, html, render} from 'hypersimple';

// components
const Button = comp(model => html`
  <button onclick=${model.onclick}>
    ${model.text}
  </button>
`);

// main App: just like any component
const App = comp(model => html`
  Lorem ipsum: ${model.count}
  <br>
  ${Button(model.button)}
`);

// model: it will be mutated to trigger updates on changes
const model = {
  count: 0,
  button: {
    text: 'increment',
    onclick() {
      // will update the view right away
      model.count += 1;
    }
  }
};

// render
render(document.body, () => App(model));
```

## API in a nutshell

  * `comp(fn)` returns a component based on some `props` or `model` object
  * the `fn` _must_ return the result of `html`
  * `html` is a template literal tag that accepts everything _hyperHTML_ can produce
  * `render(where, what)` will populate the content of a generic node with whatever a component returns

A component can `Comp.update(model)` to explicitly update some part of the layout, or batch multiple updates at once via `Comp.update(model, {...changes})`.

The `model` _will be modified_ to reflect any change of any of its properties in the UI.

If you use immutable structures, you'll trash the whole layout each time so ... to keep it simple, as the project suggest, but also memory safe, just pass any model you want, and update it right away instead of duplicating it.

The whole idea is to abstract away everything that's more complicated than setting, or updating, a property.
